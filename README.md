Laptop price prediction especially when the laptop is coming direct from the factory to Electronic Market/
Stores, is both a critical and important task. The mad rush that we saw in 2020 for laptops to support remote
work and learning is no longer there. In India, demand of Laptops soared after the Nationwide lockdown,
leading to 4.1-Million-unit shipments in the June quarter of 2021, the highest in the five years. Accurate Laptop
price prediction involves expert knowledge, because price usually depends on many distinctive features and
factors. Typically, most significant ones are brand and model, RAM, ROM, GPU, CPU, etc. In this paper, we
applied different methods and techniques in order to achieve higher precision of the used laptop price prediction.

I will make a project to predict the price of laptops based on user input. The problem we are addressing is that there are many different combinations of configurations that can be done, so if people want to buy a new laptop, then our app should have all the prices sorted by their configuration. Although it looks like a simple project or just developing a model, the dataset we have is noisy and needs lots of feature engineering, and pre-processing that will make your interest in developing this project higher.
